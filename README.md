This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `Routes` component in React Router v6. The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from providing incorrect children to the `Routes` component, leading to unexpected routing behavior or rendering failures. The solution involves correctly nesting `Route` components within the `Routes` component.
